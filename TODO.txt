Ideas to add
    more projectile patterns (bounce between enemies, fragmentation effect, multiples in one...)
    aura/projectile effects like pushback & co
    ground effects 'torrent.png' as example
    Bosses with aura/projectile as player
    store tilemap layers elsewhere as i did with spells to be reusable with an Object.assign() to integrate other waves of enemies on the same map
    waves/spawn interval rework
    resolution.js modify to max unzoom on small screen
